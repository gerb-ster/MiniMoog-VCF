# YUSynth MiniMoog VCF

No system is complete without some good VCF’s. And one excellent source for some good VCF is designs is, offcourse, the website of Yven Usson, also known as YuSynth. And this VCF is no exception. It’s a clone of the famous VCF found in the MiniMoog. I’ve made an eurorack version.
